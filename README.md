# Zi Huang 黄紫
Welcome to my personal website under construction! I am Zi Huang, a PhD student at the [Department of Translation and Language Sciences](https://www.upf.edu/web/phd-tradlangsci) at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/). I am a member of [GLiF](https://www.upf.edu/web/glif), or Grup de Lingüística Formal ("Formal Linguistics Research Group" in Catalan). I work in formal semantics and natural language ontology. Here is [my CV](https://github.com/zi-huang-upf/zi-huang-upf.github.io/files/10373073/CV.Zi.Huang.pdf).

This website demonstrates my current level of html and JavaScript programming, which is non-existent. This will change. I code in Python and know SQL.

If you want to find me, just send an email to [first-name].[last-name]@upf.edu.

## Update:
**2023.01.12-14** I will make an oral presentation on "POSS-*ing* as Kimian states" at [NELS53](https://nels53.uni-goettingen.de/), University of Göttingen.
