        <span id="q-minesweeper">
          Name one meaningless thing that I spent way too much time on.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer" id="a-minesweeper">
        Minesweeper. I started playing in December 2020 and I am a top 100
        player on Minesweeper.online as for April 2023.

      <p class="question">
        How many language courses have I finished on
        <span id="q-duolingo">Duolingo</span>?
      </p>
      <p class="answer" id="a-duolingo">
        Before the learning path update, I had finished Italian, Irish
        (forgotten), Catalan, Hungarian (forgotten), Turkish (forgotten). At
        some earlier point I had also finished French, but then the course
        updated and I didn't bother to keep going. As for now, only the German
        course is fully finished. I'm currently learning Esperanto, because I
        want to keep my 1k+ day streak, but I don't have the bandwidth to learn
        new words and grammar.<br />
        Lesson I learned? Don't learn langauges that I won't use. I will forget
        them.

      <p class="question">What is that header background picture?</p>
      <p class="answer" id="a-floribunda">

        <i>Floribunda</i>, which I colored with watercolor pencils a few years
        ago.
