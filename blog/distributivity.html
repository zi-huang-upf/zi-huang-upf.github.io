          I'm a semanticist, but let's be honest, I don't do distributivity. I
          have read about it - in the
          <a
            href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118882139"
            >Handbook of Contemporary Semantic Theory</a
          >. I have taken a course about it - it was
          <a href="https://www.leliaglass.com/home">Lelia Glass</a>'s
          <a href="https://www.essllidistributivity.com/">course</a> at ESSLLI
          2019 in Riga, probably the most interactive semantic course that I've
          even taken. And my co-disciple Kata Wohlmuth wrote
          <a href="https://core.ac.uk/reader/224782710">her thesis</a> on it.
          (When Lelia mentioned Kata's thesis in class, I was like "Wooow! I
          have the same supervisor as her!") But I never cared too much about
          distributivity. Why would I care about having three boys carry two
          pianos, anyway? What matters is that three boys participated, and two
          pianos ended up being moved. That's the cumulative reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also a passionate fan of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a
          >. I would go to any concert in Barcelona that played his music, and
          would read any material about him that I could find. That's how I
          noticed that the same stories are told slightly differently by
          different authors - sometimes due to their understanding of
          distributivity.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox box--pink">
        <p>
          One of such stories is about his
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto_for_the_Left_Hand_(Ravel)"
            >Concerto for the Left Hand</a
          >, a piece commissioned by the Austrian pianist
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wittgenstein"
            >Paul Wittgenstein</a
          >, who had lost his right arm in the First World War. When Ravel
          finished writing this piece, Wittgenstein paid him a visit at his
          home, where Ravel explained and demostrated the new piece on his
          piano. (Spoiler: Wittgenstein wasn't very impressed.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, a concerto is usually played on one (or a couple of) solo
          instrument plus an orchestra. But you can't always have an orchestra
          with you, so for demonstration purposes, it is very handy to have an
          orchestral reduction which can be played on a piano. (There is
          definitely more to it - a composer can first make a sketch of the
          concerto on a piano, and then rework it for the orchestra. Some
          concertos are just never meant to be played with an orchestra, such as
          Seitz's student concertos. Some composers just write the soloist part
          and the piano part and call it a concerto. For example, Raffaele
          Calace's 2nd mandolin concerto - but it is absolutely stunning
          <a href="https://youtu.be/9BqWsRFXjwQ">with a string orchestra</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, what Ravel demonstrated was a concerto with a piano part for
          left hand only, and an orchestral reduction meant to be played with
          both hands. (The score for this version can be found on
          <a href="https://imslp.org/">imslp</a>, and can be heard
          <a href="https://youtu.be/a-YjfZFZbQs">on YouTube</a>.) And surely
          Ravel had just one piano and two hands. How did he demonstrate the
          piece, then?

          The other story is about Ravel's
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto_in_G_(Ravel)"
            >Piano Concerto in G major</a
          >. This piece has a breathtaking second movement, Adagio Assai, which
          you can use to try attracting people to classical music. (Somehow,
          after I had fallen in love with this piece, I found a recording of it
          in my computer which a friend sent me about ten years ago. Obviously
          he made a good try, but I wasn't impressed at that time.) It has a
          very long, slow, beautiful melody.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the concerto was dedicated to, and was premiered by the pianist
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_Long"
            >Marguerite Long</a
          >. She complained that the flowing melody was hard to play, to which
          Ravel replied:
