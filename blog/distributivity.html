        I'm a semanticist, but let's be honest, I don't do distributivity. I
        have read about it - in the
        <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118882139"
          >Handbook of Contemporary Semantic Theory</a
        >. I have taken a course about it - it was
        <a href="https://www.leliaglass.com/home">Lelia Glass</a>'s
        <a href="https://www.essllidistributivity.com/">course</a> at ESSLLI
        2019 in Riga, it was probably the most interactive semantic course that
        I've even taken. And my co-disciple Kata Wohlmuth wrote
        <a href="https://core.ac.uk/reader/224782710">her thesis</a> on it.
        (When Lelia mentioned Kata's thesis in class, I was like "Wooow! I have
        the same supervisor as her!") But I never cared too much about
        distributivity. Why would I care about having three boys carry two
        pianos, anyway? What matters is that three boys participated, and two
        pianos ended up being moved. That's the cumulative reading.
      </p>

        I'm also a passionate fan of Maurice Ravel, and would read any material
        about him that I could find. That's how I noticed that the same stories
        are told slightly differently by different authors - sometimes due to
        their understanding of distributivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of such stories is about his Concerto for the Left Hand, a piece
        commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who had lost his
        right arm in the First World War. When Ravel finished writing this
        piece, Wittgenstein paid him a visit at his home, where Ravel explained
        and demostrated the new piece on his piano.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, a concerto is usually played on one (or a couple of) solo
        instrument plus an orchestra. But you can't always have an orchestra
        with you, so for demonstration purposes, it is very handy to have an
        orchestral reduction which can be played on a piano. (There is
        definitely more to it - a composer can first make a sketch of the
        concerto on a piano, and then rework it for the orchestra. Some
        concertos are just never meant to be played with an orchestra, such as
        Seitz's student concertos. Some composers just write the soloist part
        and the piano part and call it a concerto. For example, Raffaele
        Calace's 2nd mandolin concerto - but it is absolutely stunning with a
        string orchestra.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, what Ravel demonstrated was a concerto with a piano part for
        left hand only, and an orchestral reduction meant to be played with both
        hands. (The score for this version can be found on imslp, and can be
        heard on YouTube.) And surely Ravel had just one piano and two hands.
        How did he demonstrate the piece, then?

      <p>The other story is about Ravel's Piano Concerto in G.</p>
