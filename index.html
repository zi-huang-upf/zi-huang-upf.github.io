      <p>
        I am Zi Huang, a PhD student in linguistics at the
        <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/phd-tradlangsci"
          >Department of Translation and Language Sciences</a
        >
        of <a href="https://www.upf.edu/">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a>. I am a
        member of <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/glif">GLiF</a>, or Grup de
        Lingüística Formal ("Formal Linguistics Research Group" in Catalan). I
        recently finished my PhD thesis
        <i
          >Verbal gerunds in English: a case study in natural language ontology
          and referentiality</i
        >
        under the supervision of
        <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/mcnally">Louise McNally</a> and will
        defend my thesis in March. I work in formal semantics and natural
        language ontology, and my thesis focuses on the interpretation of two
        verbal gerund nominalizations in English (<i>Zi's writing her thesis</i>
        vs <i>Zi writing her thesis</i>) with both corpus and experimental data.
        I am actively looking for a job right now. Here is
        <a href="files/CV-Zi-Huang-2024-02.pdf">my CV</a>.

      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%B4%AB#Chinese"
          >My first name</a
        >
        can be a bit tricky to pronounce, but a dzzzz noise will do the job. One
        of my biggest passions is solving puzzles, and this leads me into
        constantly learning new languages. I am a native speaker of Mandarin and
        Wu Chinese, work in English, Spanish and Catalan, and read some German,
        French, Italian and Esperanto for fun. I code in Python and love to
        learn new skills.

        This website demonstrates my current level of html, css and JavaScript
        programming, which is steadily improving. ChatGPT has helped a lot in
        the creation of this site, but I have turned to more professional
        courses. Check out my learning progress from the
