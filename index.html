      <p>
        My name is Zi Huang. I am a linguist and mainly work in formal semantics
        and natural language ontology. Since September 2024, I work as a
        university assistant (postdoc) at
        <a href="https://sprachwissenschaft.uni-graz.at/de/"
          >Institut für Sprachwissenschaft</a
        >, <a href="https://www.uni-graz.at/en/">University of Graz</a>. Here is
        <a href="files/CV-Zi-Huang-2025-06.pdf">a recent CV</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated with a PhD degree in linguistics at the
        <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/phd-tradlangsci"
          >Department of Translation and Language Sciences</a
        >, <a href="https://www.upf.edu/">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a>. My
        thesis
        <i
          >Verbal gerunds in English: a case study in natural language ontology
          and referentiality</i
        >
        was developed under the supervision of
        <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/mcnally">Louise McNally</a> and
        defended in March 2024. My thesis focuses on the interpretation of two
        verbal gerund nominalizations in English (<i>Zi's writing her thesis</i>
        vs <i>Zi writing her thesis</i>) based on corpus data. During my studies
        at UPF, I was a member of
        <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/glif">GLiF</a>, or Grup de Lingüística
        Formal ("Formal Linguistics Research Group" in Catalan).

        can be a bit tricky to pronounce, but a dzzzz noise will do the job. I
        have many passions. One of them is languages: I am a native speaker of
        Mandarin and Wu Chinese, I speak English, Spanish and Catalan and I'm
        currently learning German. I am a proud cross-stitcher: please check out
        my <a href="cross_stitch.html">stitching portfolio</a>!

      <p>
        I code in Python and love to learn new skills. This website demonstrates
        my current level of html, css and JavaScript programming, which is
        steadily improving. ChatGPT has helped a lot in the creation of this
        site, but I have turned to more professional courses. Check out my
        learning progress from the
        <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a>!
