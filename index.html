		<p>I am Zi Huang, a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/phd-tradlangsci">Department of Translation and Language Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.upf.edu/">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a>. I am a member of <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/glif">GLiF</a>, or Grup de Lingüística Formal ("Formal Linguistics Research Group" in Catalan). I'm currently writing my PhD thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/mcnally">Louise McNally</a>. I work in formal semantics and natural language ontology, and my thesis focuses on the interpretation of two verbal gerund nominalizations in English (<i>Zi's writing her thesis</i> vs <i>Zi writing her thesis</i>). Here is <a href="files/CV-Zi-Huang-2023.03.pdf">my CV</a>.</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%B4%AB#Chinese">My first name</a> can be a bit tricky to pronounce, but a dzzzz noise will do the job. One of my biggest passions is decoding messages, and this leads me into constantly learning new languages. I am a native speaker of Mandarin and Wu Chinese, work in English, Spanish and Catalan, and read some German, French, Italian and Esperanto.</p>
