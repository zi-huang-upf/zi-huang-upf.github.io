      <p>
        I am Zi Huang, a PhD student in linguistics at the
        <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/phd-tradlangsci"
          >Department of Translation and Language Sciences</a
        >
        of <a href="https://www.upf.edu/">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a>. I am a
        member of <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/glif">GLiF</a>, or Grup de
        Lingüística Formal ("Formal Linguistics Research Group" in Catalan). I'm
        currently writing my PhD thesis under the supervision of
        <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/mcnally">Louise McNally</a>. I work in
        formal semantics and natural language ontology, and my thesis focuses on
        the interpretation of two verbal gerund nominalizations in English (<i
          >Zi's writing her thesis</i
        >
        vs <i>Zi writing her thesis</i>) with both corpus and experimental data.
        Here is <a href="files/CV-Zi-Huang-2023.03.pdf">my CV</a>.

        can be a bit tricky to pronounce, but a dzzzz noise will do the job. One
        of my biggest passions is solving puzzles, and this leads me into
        constantly learning new languages. I am a native speaker of Mandarin and
        Wu Chinese, work in English, Spanish and Catalan, and read some German,
        French, Italian and Esperanto for fun. I code in Python and love to
        learn new skills.

        This website demonstrates my current level of html, css and JavaScript
        programming, which is steadily improving. ChatGPT has helped a lot in
        the creation of this site, but I have turned to more professional
        courses. Check out my learning progress from the
