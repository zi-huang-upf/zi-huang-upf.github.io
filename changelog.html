        14/04/2023: Normalize.css, changed a bunch of selectors, played with
        hyperlink styles, new favicon (drew it pixel by pixel myself). Later:
        wanted to try out some css animation but found that I needed JavaScript
        for that. So I learned some JavaScript. Check out the More About Me
        page!
      </p>
      <p>
        13/04/2023: I enrolled in

        a page from Leila Duly's <i>Floribunda</i> which I colored a few years
        ago.
      </p>
      <p>

          For a long time I had joked with my thesis supervisor that I wanted to
          become a typesetter.<br />
          Now I think a front-end developer is cooler.
