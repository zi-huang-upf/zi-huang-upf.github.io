      <h2>Changelog</h2>
      <p>
        13/04/2023: I enrolled in Code With Mosh's HTML5 & CSS3 Series! Started
        to use VSCode, made negligible changes to things like &lt;meta&gt and
        Back To Top;.
      </p>
      <p>
        12/04/2023: Added News/Blog and More About Me pages. This time I did the
        coding without ChatGPT. I'm actually learning html and css!
      </p>
      <p>11/04/2023: Added changelog.</p>
      <p>
        10/04/2023: Changed fonts. Fonts on this website are now provided by
        <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. Moved navigation
        menu (thanks, ChatGPT!). Changed header background. Now it is a photo of
        a page from Leila Duly's <i>Floribunda</i> which I colored a few years
        ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        02/04/2023: Readme.md replaced by html pages. Now my website looks like
        a personal website. Thanks, ChatGPT!
      </p>
      <p>09/01/2023: Webpage created from readme.md.</p>

          For a long time I had joked with my thesis supervisor that I wanted to
          become a typesetter.<br />
          Now I think a front-end developer is cooler.
